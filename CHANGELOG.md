# Change Log

All notable changes to the "zephyr-tools" extension will be documented in this file.

### [0.3.6]

Added:

- Default project configuration constant for consistent sysbuild behavior across all commands

Changed:

- Sysbuild is now enabled by default for all new projects (was previously disabled)
- Added 7zip-bin as external dependency in esbuild configuration to prevent binary bundling

Fixed:

- 7zip extraction ENOENT errors by excluding 7zip-bin from bundling, allowing binary files to remain in node_modules

- Load via Bootloader now supports both .signed.bin (newer SDK) and .bin (older SDK) file formats

### [0.3.5]

Added:

- Python version detection to ensure Python 3.10+ is used for virtual environment creation

- Fixed race condition in "Init Repo" where pip install ran before west update completed

- Fixed toolchain selection QuickPick focus loss by moving selection outside progress window
